# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take 100 days of code challenge. Created repository to record progress of everyday.

**Thoughts:** Today, I got an email from freecodecamp.org. There I got to read about 100DaysofCode Challenge. I slightly modified the rule 2 about sharing progress on twitter. Hope so, It will complete successfully.
